            <p>Nature writing is nonfiction or fiction prose or poetry about the natural environment. Nature writing
                encompasses a wide variety of works, ranging from those that place primary emphasis on natural history
                facts (such as field guides) to those in which philosophical interpretation predominate. It includes
                natural history essays, poetry, essays of solitude or escape, as well as travel and adventure writing.

                Nature writing often draws heavily on scientific information and facts about the natural world; at the
                same time, it is frequently written in the first person and incorporates personal observations of and
                philosophical reflections upon nature.

                Modern nature writing traces its roots to the works of natural history that were popular in the second
                half of the 18th century and throughout the 19th. An important early figure was the "parson-naturalist"
                Gilbert White (1720 â€“ 1793), a pioneering English naturalist and ornithologist. He is best known for his
                Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789).
